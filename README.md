# turbulent-particle-effect
This interactive project features a dynamic image distortion effect. Hovering over the card triggers a turbulent "glitch" animation, where the visual momentarily dissolves into chaotic digital static before smoothly reforming. It combines pulse animations with randomized noise patterns to create a fluid, high-tech visual experience.
